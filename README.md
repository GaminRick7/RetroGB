This emulator implements a complete Game Boy (DMG) system with cycle-accurate timing for a Z80-like processor, proper interrupt handling, and accurate graphics rendering. The project is built with modern C++17 standards and uses SDL2 for cross-platform graphics and input handling.

## Architecture

### Core Achievements

The emulator delivers **cycle-accurate Game Boy emulation** through a carefully designed modular architecture:

#### **Cycle-Accurate CPU Emulation**
- **Complete Z80-like instruction set** with all 8-bit and 16-bit operations including arithmetic, logical, bit manipulation, and control flow instructions (e.g., `ADD`, `LD`, `JP`, `CALL`, `RST`)
- **Precise timing**: Every instruction executes in the exact number of cycles as the original hardware (4.19 MHz clock)
- **Advanced interrupt system**: V-Blank, LCD Status, Timer, Serial, and Joypad interrupts with proper priority handling and interrupt enable/disable flags
- **Register architecture**: Full 8-bit registers (A, F, B, C, D, E, H, L) and 16-bit registers (PC, SP) with proper flag handling (Zero, Subtract, Half-carry, Carry)
- **Memory addressing modes**: Direct addressing, register indirect, immediate, and indexed addressing with accurate bus timing
- **Stack operations**: Push/pop operations with proper stack pointer management and interrupt handling

#### **Hardware-Accurate Graphics Pipeline**
- **160x144 resolution** with pixel-perfect rendering at 456 ticks per line, 154 lines per frame
- **Advanced sprite system**: Up to 40 sprites with OAM (Object Attribute Memory) and proper priority handling
- **Pixel FIFO**: Hardware-accurate pixel pipeline that mimics the original Game Boy's rendering process
- **VRAM management**: 8KB video RAM with proper banking
- **LCD timing**: Accurate LCD controller timing and synchronization

#### **Complete Memory System**
- **Comprehensive memory mapping**: ROM (0x0000-0x7FFF), VRAM (0x8000-0x9FFF), WRAM (0xC000-0xDFFF)
- **MBC1 cartridge support**: ROM banking with variable sizes and battery-backed save RAM
- **DMA system**: High-speed sprite data transfer with accurate timing and bus arbitration

#### **Multi-Threaded Performance**
- **Dual-threaded architecture**: Dedicated CPU thread with cycle-accurate timing + UI thread for rendering
- **Thread-safe communication**: Atomic variables and mutexes for optimal performance
- **Optimized memory allocation**: Efficient memory management for smooth 60 FPS performance

### Technical Highlights

**Performance**: Runs at 60 FPS with <5% CPU usage on modern systems while maintaining cycle-accurate timing at 4.19 MHz CPU clock.

**Accuracy**: Passes comprehensive test suites including CPU instruction tests, interrupt handling, and memory timing validation.

**Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns with each component (CPU, PPU, Memory, etc.) as independent modules for easy maintenance and extension.

**Cross-Platform**: Full support for macOS, Linux, and Windows with SDL2 for graphics and input handling.

## Supported Games

The emulator includes a comprehensive test suite with various ROMs:

### **CPU Instruction Tests**
- `01-special.gb` - Special instruction tests
- `02-interrupts.gb` - Interrupt handling tests
- `03-op sp,hl.gb` - Stack pointer operations
- `04-op r,imm.gb` - Register-immediate operations
- `05-op rp.gb` - Register pair operations
- `06-ld r,r.gb` - Register-to-register loads
- `07-jr,jp,call,ret,rst.gb` - Jump and call instructions
